## Getting Started with Machine Learning

Welcome! Let's dive into the world of machine learning. In this exercise, we've utilized the powerful `scikit-learn` library to conduct some tests.

### Dataset and Data Preparation

We've worked with a dataset of flowers, performing careful data cleaning to ensure the quality of our analysis.

### Model Building

Our initial goal was to develop a model capable of correctly identifying the type of flower. Using `scikit-learn`, we've created and trained the model.

### Performance Evaluation

The result obtained was a score of 66%. While it's a good starting point, we realize that there is still plenty of room for improvement.

### Future Goal

We aim to achieve a higher score, ideally in the range of 80/85%. We will continue to work hard to optimize the model and reach this ambitious goal.

Thank you for joining us on this journey into the fascinating world of machine learning!
